Algo for interactive session
1. select secret word at random from some source
2. display a row of dashes one for each letter in the secret word
3. for a correct guess
  update the dashes to display all instances of the correctly guessed letter
4. for each incorrect guess, the user is penalised. we record this
5. the game ends in a 
	1. Loss if the user makes 8 incorrect guesses
  	2. Win if the user gueses all the letters before exhausting the 8 guesses 


Graphics
drawing an evolving picture of the user being hanged at a scaffold
each incorrect guess will lead to the addition of a new part to the
user being hanged at the scaffold in this order
(scaffold is already prepared)
1. head
2. body
3. left arm
4. right arm
5. left leg *
6. right leg *
7. left foot *
8. right foot *

3 PART DESIGN
1. interactive console with preselected text
2. introducing the scaffold
3. replace preselected text with words from a file

SO FAR
I believe that I've already completed the first
and third design requirements. All that is left is the graphics

ADDING THE GRAPHICS
The homework suggested that we have our main console app. Then start a gui
window with the scaffold prepared when the console app begins. we then use 
the gui window object to make changes to the gui like adding parts of the
scaffold, updating the guessed words and showing the actual word in its form.

That is more or less what we will do

1. Create such a class with the ff methods
	something to show the gui and initialize the scaffold
	someway to update the label for guessed words
	means of updating the actual secret word
	means of notifying the gui of a wrong guess so that it can
	draw the next body part

class HangmanCanvas:
	init
	create_scaffold
	notifyincorrectGuess
	update_secret_word
	update_guessed_words

we intended to use turtle for the drawing. 

turtle graphics can be drawn on a tkinter.Canvas object.
We shall thus use tkinter to develop the gui for
